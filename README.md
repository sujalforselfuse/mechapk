# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

================   git command ===========================


git clone https://github.com/sujalforselfuse/mech-web1.git
git status
git add .
git commit -m 'updatedByalok'
git push origin main
The command git push origin main is used to send the changes made in the local Git repository to the corresponding remote repository on GitHub. The term 'origin' refers to the remote repository where the project was initially cloned from. In this context, 'main' represents the name of the branch on which the changes have been made. When executed, this command uploads the committed changes from the local branch to the remote repository, effectively updating the 'main' branch on GitHub with the latest changes.

git pull origin main 
When there are any changes in the GitHub repository, we utilize the git pull origin main command to update those changes onto our local server. This allows us to view and assess the modifications effectively.
